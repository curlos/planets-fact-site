## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ChakraUI](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS Framework
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learned how to use ChakraUI and work with it's different components. It is almost like TailwindCSS but using their own components to style a page with props to style to your liking instead of using utility classes.

### Continued development

I will use ChakraUI in future projects as I really like the framework and this site was a test run of using this framework for the first time. In the future, I'll use this on a bigger project.

### Useful resources
